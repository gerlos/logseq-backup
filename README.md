# logseq-backup

Bash script to crate backup archives of [logseq](https://logseq.com/) graphs, inspired by the workflow of [Joplin Backup Plugin](https://github.com/JackGruber/joplin-plugin-backup). It can run automatic backups through Systemd.

## Requirements and Install

Requires `7z` binary to create archives. You can get it running `sudo apt install p7zip*` on Debian/Ubuntu or `sudo dnf install p7zip*` on Fedora. 

To enable (optional) automatic backup you need a Systemd-based distro. 

Then download, fork or copy and paste the script to your machine and make it executable.

```bash
 $ chmod +x logseq-backup.sh
```
